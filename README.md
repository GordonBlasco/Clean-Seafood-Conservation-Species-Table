# Introduction
Synthetic meat (A.K.A Lab-grown meat) has been hyped to have the potential to reduce environmental stress from traditional food production systems. When it comes to fisheries [our research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/faf.12541) makes the case that lab-grown meat is unlikely to provide a conservation benefit for wild fish stocks. 

However, many companies are still using environmental reasoning in their marketing materials. See [here.](https://www.bluenalu.com/why-1) For companies entering the space they may still want to choose a species to synthesize that has both the need for conservation efforts as well as a large market segment. This app synthesizes information from various datasets on both conservation metrics and market value for ~2000 consumed fish species.
